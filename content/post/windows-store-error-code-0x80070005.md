I recently starting an issue where none of the programs I've installed
via the Windows Store would update. Specifically they'd fail during the
installation with an error code of 0x80070005 with no actual description
of what the problem is (Microsoft still [erroring like it's 1989](/images/1200px-PC_Load_Letter.jpg)).

I searched all over the place but either I wasn't willing to try the
solutions because they were unreasonable, such as wiping my user profile
because it _might_ be corrupted with no way of checking whether this was
actually the case, or they simply didn't work.

Turned out the issue was simply that there was an update for Windows 10
available and I hadn't received a notification, nor had Windows 10 done
it's usual thing of updating without telling me and rebooting my machine
without asking.

__TL;DR: Update Windows 10 to the latest version (1903 in my case).__
