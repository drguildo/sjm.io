I recently got an Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet and for the most part it's been running fine. However, I encountered a weird and annoying issue where, all of a sudden, I had what seem to be system/hidden apps showing up on my Home screen.

The apps in question were, IIRC, _Device Setup_, _Downloads_, _Music_, _Kindle Store_ and maybe one more that I can't find/remember.

The solution was to go to Settings → Apps & Notifications → Manage All Application → Home Pages → Storage. When there, tap _Force Stop_ and _Clear Data_. That should get rid of the stray icons.
